A personal AI agent skill/plugin marketplace housing one options-trading skill (compatible with Claude Code, Gemini Antigravity, OpenClaw, and other agentic coding assistants) — backed by a curated [Open Knowledge Format (OKF)](plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/OKF.md) library of 27 pitfalls and case studies (INTC, Mag-7, APP, NOK, TSEM, CBRS, SNOW, MDB, VIX, SATS, 6981). Layout follows the [`himself65/finance-skills`](https://github.com/himself65/finance-skills) convention.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code — Install the plugin / skill

```bash
npx plugins add himself65/trade-skills
# or just the skill
npx skills add himself65/trade-skills
```

### Gemini Antigravity — Install the skill

Clone the repository and symlink or copy the skill directory into one of Gemini's customization roots:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xupengufo/trade-skills.git ~/trade-skills
# Link as project-scoped skill (create .agents/skills/ directory if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p .agents/skills
ln -s ~/trade-skills/plugins/trade/skills/trade .agents/skills/trade
# Or link as a global skill
ln -s ~/trade-skills/plugins/trade/skills/trade ~/.gemini/config/skills/trade
```

### Other agents (OpenClaw, etc.)

```bash
npx skills add himself65/trade-skills -a <agent-name>
# For manual local development install (from a clone)
git clone https://github.com/xupengufo/trade-skills.git ~/trade-skills
ln -s ~/trade-skills/plugins/trade/skills/trade ~/.claude/skills/trade
```

## Available Skills

### Trade (`trade`)

Multi-leg options trading assistant with concrete strikes, IV-aware structures, and probability-weighted scenarios.

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| [trade](plugins/trade/skills/trade/) | Options trading knowledge base — 27 pitfalls + 11 case studies (INTC, Mag-7, APP, NOK, TSEM, CBRS, SNOW, MDB, VIX, SATS, 6981) + structure-to-regime framework. Lazy-loaded, OKF-conformant. |

## Open Knowledge Format

The skill's knowledge base is an **[Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1](plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/OKF.md)** bundle — a portable, vendor-neutral graph of markdown concept files with YAML frontmatter, navigable via `index.md` and version-controlled alongside the code. Each pitfall, case study, and framework is a typed concept.

- [`references/OKF.md`](plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/OKF.md) — type vocabulary, frontmatter schema, and conformance contract
- [`references/index.md`](plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/index.md) — the bundle root / graph entry point
- [`references/log.md`](plugins/trade/skills/trade/references/log.md) — chronological change history
